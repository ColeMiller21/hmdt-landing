    question: "ðŸ”¥ (8 spots) Bidding:",
    answer:
      "Top8 bidders will be chosen in this cycle once the bid is concluded. Their balance will be reduced by a certain amount of $HP, where the exact amount is defined as the lowest bidding amount of $HP among these Top8 holders.",
  },
  {
    question: "ðŸ”¥ (6 spots) All-holder raffle:",
    answer:
      "All the holders will have the equal probability to get selected once their $HP exceeds the threshold (this threshold will be lower than HP median/mean over the entire holder distributing), in order to cover most of our holders. Threshold $HP will be deducted from the balance of raffle winners.",
  },
  {
    question: "ðŸ”¥ (2 spots) Engagement Group:",
    answer:
      " The most engaged HMDT holders on Twitter/DC will be added to the engagement group. 2 deboggers from the engagement group will be selected holders for each Debog cycle. Current downtime for each selected holder: 1 Debog Cycle (meaning if you get selected in this group for this debog cycle, you cannot get selected for this group in the next debog cycle).",
  },
  {
    question: "What is this protocol?",
    answer: `A mechanism that holders pay NOTHING, need NO gas-required operations on their end, and win ETH from an algorithmic-trading protocol (aka HMDT Algo-Bot). Initial deposit is funded by community vault. Loss (if any) is covered by community vault. ETH gained by the Algo-Bot is split as winnings for selected holders and community vault`,
